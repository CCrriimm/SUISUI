You are a senior C# engineer debugging a live aim-assist system (Aimmy).

We have already fixed:
- Target selection (ByteTrack is correct)
- Sticky aim logic
- IoU vs small-box instability

However, the aim is STILL off, and new debug logs confirm the remaining issue.

This is NOT a tracking bug.
This is NOT a Kalman bug.
This is NOT a YOLO timing bug.

This is a COORDINATE SPACE ERROR.

---

## ROOT CAUSE (MANDATORY TO FIX)

The aim system is still using YOLO-space rectangles for aiming math.

From debug logs:
- `closestPrediction.ScreenCenterX/Y` are correct (screen space)
- `closestPrediction.Rectangle` is YOLO-relative (relative to detectionBox)
- CalculateCoordinates() computes detectedX/Y from Rectangle math
- MouseManager.MoveCrosshair() expects SCREEN-SPACE pixels

This causes the aim to move in the wrong direction because:
- YOLO-space coordinates are being fed into screen-space movement
- detectionBox offsets are effectively applied twice
- targets near edges are especially wrong

---

## NON-NEGOTIABLE RULE

**Aiming must use SCREEN-SPACE ONLY.**

Rectangles are allowed ONLY for:
- overlay drawing
- trigger checks
- visualization

Rectangles must NEVER be used for aiming math.

---

## REQUIRED FIX (MANDATORY)

In CalculateCoordinates():

### ❌ REMOVE all aim math based on:
- `LastDetectionBox`
- `closestPrediction.Rectangle`
- rectangle center calculations

### ✅ REPLACE with screen-space logic:

Use:
```

closestPrediction.ScreenCenterX
closestPrediction.ScreenCenterY

```

These values:
- are already in screen coordinates
- already include detectionBox offsets
- already include tracking prediction
- are the single source of truth for aim

### Example (conceptual):

```

detectedX = (int)closestPrediction.ScreenCenterX;
detectedY = (int)closestPrediction.ScreenCenterY;

```

Apply user offsets (X/Y offset, percentages, alignment) **in screen space only**.

---

## IMPORTANT CLARIFICATION

DO NOT:
- Convert ScreenCenter back into YOLO space
- Re-derive centers from rectangles
- Subtract detectionBox.Left / Top for aiming

Those conversions are ONLY for matching and overlay.

---

## HARD CONSTRAINTS

- DO NOT modify ByteTracker logic
- DO NOT modify KalmanPrediction
- DO NOT modify ONNX inference or capture code
- DO NOT change user settings behavior
- Make minimal, surgical changes only
